# Purpose of This Site

This site is an interactive timeline that explains the major stages of human evolution in a simple, visual, and easy-to-understand way. Each slide represents a different era, from the earliest primates all the way to modern humans. The goal is to take what we learned in class and present it in a clear, engaging format that anyone can follow.

The website helps show how different concepts connect across the course: early evolutionary principles, primate biology, fossil evidence, hominin traits, and modern human development. By combining images, short explanations, and a step-by-step timeline, the project makes human evolution feel more approachable and easier to visualize without heavy scientific language.

Overall, the purpose of the site is to teach the story of human evolution in a creative, accurate, and accessible way that communicates complex ideas through simple design.
